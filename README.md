- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ... in fact any contribution is welcomed.

### OSS libs:

### Here, people usually put all libraries/frameworks that upon time ago wrote a single line of code

My work experience is focused on ASPNET (4.X to core versions) and python. Of course, i have the same experience on javascript (GOD no JQuery, ECMAScript has a lot of things now!). But as a good Computer science ingenieer i am tremendly bad chosing colors and designing beautifull things. If i have to do a frontend without a mock from  scratch it will be a funcitonal fronted but a bit tasteless :P
